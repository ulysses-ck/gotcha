**real** simple system fetch with the looks..? (is this a hyperland reference??)

![demo](/assets/demo.gif)

### why gotcha over x?

1. gotcha has no external deps.
2. it is published under public domain.
3. simple yet beautiful.
4. `NO_COLOR` spec compliant.
5. fassssst!ยน
6. well-documented. (ig)
7. rejects modern scum. macos are not supported (and will never be). (windows may be supported)
8. approved by jesus.
9. idk.

> ยน: gpu data makes the program slower, use `SKIP_GPU_DATA=1` to skip it.

i've seen some "minimal" system fetch with a boatload of deps
just for displaying basic system info, ridiculous.

so i decided to make gotcha (and [novofetch](https://github.com/yehorovye/novofetch), another minimal
system fetch in V).
