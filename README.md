# gotcha

**real** simple system fetch with the looks..? (is this a hyperland reference??)

### why gotcha over x?

1. gotcha has no external deps.
2. it is published under public domain.
3. simple yet beautiful.
4. `NO_COLOR` spec compliant.
5. fassssst!
6. well-documented. (ig)
7. rejects modern scum. windows or macos are not supported (and will never be).
8. approved by jesus.
9. idk.

i've seen some "minimal" system fetch with a boatload of deps
just for displaying basic system info, ridiculous.

so i decided to make gotcha (and [novofetch](https://github.com/yehorovye/novofetch), another minimal
system fetch in V).
